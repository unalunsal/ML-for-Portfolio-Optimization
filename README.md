Let`s start with very common way for optimum stock selection for portfolio construction which is Sharpe Ratio. 
Sharpe Ratio is used by portfolio managers / investors to understand investment return compared to its risk. 

Sharpe Ratio = (Rp - Rf) / 𝜎𝑝

Rp : Return of Portfolio
Rf : Risk-free rate 
𝜎𝑝 : Standard Deviation of Portfolio`s Excess Return
